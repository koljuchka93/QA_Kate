:beetle:	 Hi! My name is Kate, and I am a QA. :beetle:	
## :pushpin: Summary
I enjoy playing games and testing, so I decided to become a QA professional[^1]. 
I'm looking for new opportunities to expand my experience and contribute to exciting projects. With my experience in quality assurance and a sincere love for gaming, I'm looking forward to bringing my skills and dedication to the team. 
The previous projects I have worked on include such genres as Survival Sandbox, PVP, Match2, Platformer, and Racing.

[^1]: It was while reading the article about mob in-game on Wikipedia that I first learned about the tester profession, which surprised me. For a long time, I had no idea that there was such a profession as QA in Ukraine.
